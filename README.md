## Workspace for the Startup Summer 2017

This repository contain all information about the lectures and serve as central repository to submit all your class works.

### General information for students

1. One day before lecture, main lecture objectives will be added to this repository. Use this materials to prepare for lecture and have basic understanding of the lecture material - that will help a lot to understand it next day.
2. For class works, create a folder with your full name (e.x. `andrew_orsich`) in a `classworks` folder. For every class work create a folder with same name as lecture name (e.x. `01_git`).

### Pull requests

#### Naming

Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for developer Andrei Orsich prefix would be ao_. In case of prefix collisions in the future the common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: aors_.

#### Reviews

Once pull request created you have to do few things:

1. Assign label `To Review`
2. Add lecturer as assignee.

If lecturer decline pull request, he will assign label `Work In Progress` and provide you with feedback about what was done wrong. Implement requested changes, push to the pull request branch and assign `To Review` label again.
